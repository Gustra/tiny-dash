Tiny-dash in a simple monitoring dashboard application for your desktop.
The purpose is to be able to monitor a lot of sensors with just a
glance, like having a radiator screen, but for the desktop instead.

It is written in [Python2][pyt], uses [twisted][twi] for asynchronous
execution, [Tkinter][tki] for presentation, and [YAML][yml] as the
configuration syntax.
